SYNOPSIS
========

 conf2struct <file.cfg>

DESCRIPTION
===========

`conf2struct` takes a configuration file that describes a
configuration file in the [libconfig](https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/) format, and generates a C parser that will read a configuration file directly into a C structure. The goal is to accept any file that is valid for `libconfig`, which in particular means using `conf2struct` does not introduce restrictions to what the configuration file should look like.

It also generates a command line interpreter based on
[argtable3](https://www.argtable.org/). Currently it allows
to create a configuration equivalent to that of the
configuration file; eventually it will allow to override
file settings from the command line.

`conf2struct` manage—ï optional settings and default values.

(A bit of history:
[sslh](http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh/README.html) uses
`libconfig`, which provides a C API. There are two downsides
to that: with the increase of the number of settings, the
code to read the configuration file grew and became harder
to read, while being all mostly boilerplate code; also,
every time it reads a setting `libconfig` traverses a tree
doing string compares on the setting names, which is very
inefficient for settings that get used very often: those
setting need to be copied to a structure. Put both problems
together, and you get this program as a solution by taking a
step up.)


Configuration file
==================

The format of the target configuration file is itself
described as a configuration file which is somewhat similar
to a schema file.

Global declarations
-------------------

The following settings are located at the root of the
configuration file:

- `header`: output file name for the struct declarations 
- `parser`: output file for the C code
- `config`: description of the target configuration file.
This contains a `name` entry which will prefix all
symbols, and a `items` declaration equivalent to that of a
group (see below).
- `conffile_option`: Array of two strings describing the
  short and long command line option that will read a
configuration file.
- `includes`: Array of header files that will be included
  first thing in the generated header file. This allows to
define types that are used as `runtime` data.

Settings
--------

The following entries are mandatory for each setting:

- `name` specifies the name of the setting
- `type` specifies the type of the setting. It is one of the
  libconfig types: `boolean`, `int`, `int64`, `float`,
`group`, `list`, `array`. Type can also be specified as `runtime` if
you want to add runtime data to the struct. The C type will
then be specified by the additionnal `c_type` setting. `c2s`
will do nothing with these types (no init, no alloc, no printing).


Scalars
-------

Scalar types take the additional following entries: 

- `default` specifies its default value. If the setting has no default,
then it is mandatory.
- `optional` specifies that a setting can be undefined.
  Undefined strings will point to NULL, and optional
settings receive an additional `<id>_is_present` boolean in the
final struct.
- `var` is a boolean to set if the variable can be modified
during runtime (i.e. it won't be declared `const`).

Groups
------

Group entries must contain an `items` setting which contains
a list of named settings. Groups can contain items of any type.

Lists
-----

List entries must contain an `items` setting which contains
the list of setting expected in each item of the list.
Lists can contain anything, including other lists.

Note this does not support items of varying types, as is
possible in libconfig. This libconfig feature feels
counter-intuitive when targeting a struct for storage.

Arrays
------

Settings of type `array` must contain an `item_type`
setting which specifies the type of the scalars contained in
the array.

Lists and arrays both get converted to a static array. A
field `<name>_len` is added containing the number of
elements in the array.


Generated API
=============

Assuming the prefix for our configuration is `foo`, two
public functions are generated:

Configuration file API
----------------------

```
int foo_parse_file(
        const char* filename,
        struct foo_items* config, 
        const char** errmsg);
```

- `filename` is the name of the file, passed directly to
libconfig.

- `config` is the root configuration struct as output by
  `conf2struct`. The parser will fill that structure and
allocate memory for groups, lists and arrays as required.

- `errmsg` is a text string that explains what went wrong if
  parsing failed (e.g. a mandatory option is missing).

`config_parser()` returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.

Printer API
-----------

```
void foo_print(struct foo_item* in, int depth);
```

`conf2struct` builds a pretty-printer that takes a `struct`
as input. It recursively descends in groups and array with
indentation. `depth` is the number of tabs to print first,
usually 0.

The goal of this function is debugging to check
`conf2struct`'s idea of what is going on, rather than for
use for production use.

Command line API
----------------

For a prefix `foo`, a command line parser will be generated:

```
int foo_cl_parse(
        int argc,
        char* argv[],
        struct foo_items* config);
```

The command line parser relies on argtable3, which is
included in this distribution. argtable3.o needs to be added
to the final project.

Error handling is performed directly by the parser, using
standard conventions: printing an error description and
synopsis in case of failure.


Command line option names is derived from the levels
specified in the configuration file: the libconfig path to
setting `application.window.pos.x` is specified as
`--applicatio-window-pos-x` command line option. Arrays and
lists can be filled by specifying the option several times.


This function specifically manages an option to read a
configuration file: if specified on the command line, the
configuration file will be read first, then the rest of the
command line options are evaluated to override configuration
file settings. The option name is specified as
`conffile_option` in the configuration root (see above). The
overriding strategy for groups, arrays and lists is to
remove all the settings from the command line as soon as one
command line option appears (this is just one of several
choices, including adding to the lists. It's not clear at
this stage if a single strategy is the way to go.)


Example
=======

The file `eg_conf.cfg` documents the `conf2struct`
configuration to build a parser for the libconfig
`example.cfg` (which is verbatim from the libconfig Web
site). `parser.c` shows a very simple parser that
also reports errors, using this example. A simple:

```
make
./example -F example.cfg
```

will produce the parser in `example.c` and `example.h` (as
specified in `eg_conf.cfg`), which parses `example.cfg` and
prints the result directly from the in-memory struct.

The following will print out the setting from the
configuration file, with some overrides 
from the command line:
```
 ./example -F example.cfg --version 2 --application-window-title=AppStore --application-window-size-w=10 --application-window-size-h=15 --application-window-pos-x=250 --application-window-pos-y=250 --application-misc-columns=blah --application-misc-columns=bleh --application-misc-columns=foo --application-books-title=foo --application-books-title=bar 
```

confcheck
=========

`conf2struct` is written in Perl, and the Perl
implementation for `libconfig` appears to be very bad at
reporting parsing errors (that, or the documentation is very
                          bad). The small `confcheck`
program can be used to validate configuration files: it will
provide the exact parse error location, if any.


TODO
====

- validation parameters, e.g. `min_length` / `max_length` for arrays and
lists, and strings, which can be verified to check the validity
of the configuration.

- Maybe, several strategies for command line override of
  arrays and lists

- A better syntax for arrays, e.g. "--opt-int 2,3,5,7"


Similar project
===============

[x2struct](https://github.com/xyz347/x2struct) does a
similar job, but for C++, added constraints to the target
configuration file (while I did not want users to have to
change existing configuration files), and I didn't see how
to extend it to get useful error messages, default values,
and setting validation.
